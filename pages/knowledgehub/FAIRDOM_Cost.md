FAIRDOMHub is a platform running the FAIRDOM-SEEK software. It can be used for free for small projects. As a rule of thumb, please get in contact with us if you want to store above 1TB of data for a project.

FAIRDOM offers the following additional data management services to cost for your project:
  * Face to face consultancy from a member of the FAIRDOM team to your project to assist with demonstrating data management, assisting upload of assets, 
    or training  for smaller groups within the project
  * Guaranteed storage space for bigger data sets
  * Bespoken development requirements of FAIRDOM-SEEK software
  * Training courses to FAIRDOMHub

In general we recommend to calculate ca. 5% of your project budget for data management costs. Details should be discussed individually.
