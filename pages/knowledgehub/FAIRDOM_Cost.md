[FAIRDOMHub](https://fairdomhub.org) is a platform running the [FAIRDOM-SEEK](https://seek4science.org) software. It can be used for free for smaller projects. As a rule of thumb, please get in contact with us if you want to store above 1TB for a project.

FAIRDOM offers the following additional data management services to cost for your project:

  * Face to face consultancy from a member of the FAIRDOM team to your project to assist with demonstrating data management, assisting upload of assets, 
    or training  for smaller groups within the project
  * Guaranteed storage space for bigger data sets
  * Bespoke development of [FAIRDOM-SEEK](https://seek4science.org) software
  * Training courses to [FAIRDOMHub](https://fairdomhub.org)

In general we recommend to calculate ca. 5% of your project budget for data management costs. However, details should be discussed individually.
