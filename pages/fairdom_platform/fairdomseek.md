The [FAIRDOM-SEEK](https://fairdomseek.org/) platform is the [open source](https://github.com/seek4science/seek) Research Data Management Platform developed and
supported by the members of the FAIRDOM consortium.

It is a mature web-based resource for organising,
sharing and publishing heterogeneous scientific research datasets, models or simulations, protocols, workflows, samples, publications and other research outcomes.
It preserves associations between them, along with information about the people and organisations.

The platform enables the building of Project Hubs where investigators can store, share, access, connect and interact with digital objects generated from their research,
and use them in their own analyses.

FAIRDOM provides a public Hub that anyone can register with and use. For more details please visit [FAIRDOMHub](/fairdomhub).
