[FAIRDOM-SEEK](https://seek4science.org/) is a project asset managemnent platform developed and supported by the members of the FAIRDOM consortium. The platform is a mature web-based resource for organising, sharing and publishing heterogeneous scientific research datasets, models or simulations, protocols, workflows, samples, publications and other research outcomes.  

The platform enables the building of Project Hubs where investigators can store, share, access, connect and interact with digital objects generated from their research, and use them in their own analyses.   

To see what changes and new features are coming, see the [FAIRDOM-SEEK Roadmap](https://docs.seek4science.org/tech/roadmap.html); 
and to track what is currently under development and planned for the upcoming version, visit the current [Project Board]({{site.github_project_board}})

*	Free Public Hubs 
*	Project Hubs installed and hosted locally
