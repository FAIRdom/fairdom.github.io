The [IBISBAHub](https://hub.ibisba.eu)is a Knowledge Hub for scientific information related to [IBISBA](https://www.ibisba.eu), the European infrastructure producing translational R&D&I services to an international community of Industrial Biotechnology.

**The IBISBAHub serves as:**
* a private collaboration space for IBISBA facilities, handing over data, models and SOPs between partners during the execution of projects;
* a private recording of the progression and outcome of member projects for IBISBA oversight;
* a library of member  contributed SOPs, models, workflows and data templates shared within the IBISBA membership. 
* a data management resource if a local system is not available to be indexed

**Features include**
    * ISA structure that has an order based on the design-build-test phases of a project
    * Helper tool iPOP to set up a project entry on the Hub 
    * Integration with a project management system and a service catalogue
    * Storing, sharing and launching workflows linked with related data and models.
