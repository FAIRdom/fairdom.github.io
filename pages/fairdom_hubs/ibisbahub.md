The [IBISBAHub](https://hub.ibisba.eu) is one of the many **Project Hubs** supported by the FAIRDOM consortium.  It is a place to share scientific information related to [IBISBA](https://www.ibisba.eu), a European infrastructure producing translational R&D&I services to an international community of industrial biotechnology.

The IBISBAHub serves as an online portal for recording progression of projects using the IBISBA facilities and storing, sharing and launching workflows linked with related data and models. The [IBISBAHub](https://hub.ibisba.eu) also complements local data management OR provides a data management resource where local system is not available.

**The IBISBAHub serves as:**
* a private collaboration space for IBISBA facilities, handing over data, models and SOPs between partners during the execution of projects;
* a private recording of the progression and outcome of member projects for IBISBA oversight;
* a library of member  contributed SOPs, models, workflows and data templates shared within the IBISBA membership. 
* a data management resource if a local system is not available to be indexed

**Features include**
    * ISA structure that has an order based on the design-build-test phases of a project
    * Helper tool iPOP to set up a project entry on the Hub 
    * Integration with a project management system and a service catalogue
    * Storing, sharing and launching workflows linked with related data and models.
