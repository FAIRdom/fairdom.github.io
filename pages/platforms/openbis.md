[OpenBIS](https://csb.ethz.ch/tools/software/openbis-lims-eln.html) is an open, distributed system for managing biological information. The main goal is to support biological research data workflows from the source 
(i.e. the measurement instruments) to facilitate the process of answering biological questions by means of cross-domain queries against raw data, processed data,
knowledge resources and its corresponding metadata. When paired with our SEEK platform it provides data management support from instrument collection through 
to publication.


### Community use

openBIS is currently being used by several [SystemsX.ch](http://www.systemsx.ch) and EU projects applying mass spectrometric measurements of metabolites and proteins, high content 
screening or next generation sequencing technologies. The attributes making it interesting to a system biology research community include: versatility, 
simplicity in deployment, scalability to very large data, flexibility to handle any biological data type and extensibility to the needs of any potential user.
