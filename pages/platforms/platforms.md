The FAIRDOM Platform uses a stack of software platforms to provide a “Project Commons” – that is, a shared place where projects 
can organise their own data, models, protocols, workflows in their own managed space.

## Integrating Data Infrastructures 

The SEEK is designed to organise data held on different data infrastructures.

NeLS is the Norwegian e-Infrastructure for Life Sciences. When paired with the FAIRDOM-SEEK  it provides a way for organising and publishing data collected 
by the ELIXIR-Norway data and analysis services.

## Helping with Metadata Management  

Rightfield is an open-source tool for adding ontology term selection to Excel spreadsheets. Rightfield is used by a ‘Template Creator’ to create semantically aware Excel spreadsheet templates. The Excel templates are then reused by Scientists to collect and annotate their data; without any need to understand, or even be aware of, Rightfield or the ontologies used. Rightfield embedded templates are used within the Samples framework of the SEEK.

## Supporting Analysis and Modelling  

### Modelling 

JWS Online is a systems biology tool for the construction, modification and simulation of kinetic models and for the storage of curated models. It can be used online, and is also integrated into the SEEK platform, to support model management.

### Workflows 

Galaxy is  a scientific workflow, data integration, and data and analysis persistence and publishing platform that aims to make computational biology accessible to research scientists that do not have computer programming or systems administration experience. Work is on-going with a number of EU projects to integrate the SEEK with Galaxy: to manage workflows, launch them and manage their data outputs.

### Executable Notebooks 

Jupyter Notebook  is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more. Using the SEEK API it is easy to integrate the SEEK with your notebook.
