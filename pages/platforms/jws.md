[JWS Online](https://jjj.mib.ac.uk/) is a systems biology tool for the construction, modification and simulation of kinetic models and for the storage of curated models. 
It can be used online, and is also integrated into the SEEK platform, to support model management.   


### Community Use 

The software integrates with BioModels database, a community repository for storing SBML models of biological systems. The visual aspects of the interface, 
ease of model construction and simulation, as well as parameter modification, have situated JWS Online as an extensively used tool for teaching modelling, 
with a number of community courses being run each year.   


### Getting JWS Online

JWS Online is web-based, and therefore all attributes of the tool can be accessed through the [website](https://jjj.mib.ac.uk/)
