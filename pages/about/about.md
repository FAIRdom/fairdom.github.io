**FAIRDOM** consortium is an open initiative of various partners including funding programmes, large-consortia, institutes, small groups as well as individuals. The prime mission is to support researchers, students, trainers, funders and publishers by enabling collaborative projects to make their data, documents operating procedures and models,  **Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR)**. To achieve this we provide an open source software platform to help projects, programmes and centres to:  

* Organise their People & Investigations  
* Organise, Catalogue, Manage & Share Outputs  
* Catalogue across different repositories    

The associate partners work together in varying degrees from using the software and providing development feedback, through to co-development of software, knowledge and broader collaboration.
