Good data management includes maximising the Findablity, Accessiblity, Interoperablity and Reusablity (FAIR) of data used in and generated during a project. This enables effective collaboration in a project, deeper insights and increases the value of the data for potential reuse.

## What’s FAIR?

The FAIR principles have been formalised in the publication "[The FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship]"(https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18). The FAIR principles ‘living document’ is now hosted and maintained at https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/.

## Practical information for data management

Every funder, university and research institute usually provide information about data management requirements and best practices. Therefore, it is recommended to be aware of the guidelines provided by your funder, university or research institute.

To get started with your Life Sciences data management, you can use the best practices and guidelines found in [RDMkit](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/data_management_plan.html).

## How does FAIRDOM help me with good data management?
