Good data management includes maximising the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and Reusability (FAIR) of data used in and generated during a project. This enables effective collaboration in a project, deeper insights and increases the value of the data for potential reuse.

## What is FAIR?

The FAIR principles have been formalised in the publication [The FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18). The [FAIR principles "living document"](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) provides a detailed overview.

## Practical information for data management

Every funder, university and research institute usually provide information about data management requirements and best practices. Therefore, it is recommended to be aware of the guidelines provided by your funder, university or research institute.

To get started with your Life Sciences data management, you can use the best practices and guidelines found in [RDMkit](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org).

## How does FAIRDOM help me with good data management?

The FAIRDOM consortium offers support for the data management within your research project. It could include consultancy from a FAIRDOM team member for your project to assist with data management planning, demonstrating good data management practices, or training courses.
