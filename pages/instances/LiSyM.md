The [LiSyM SEEK](https://seek.lisym.org) is one of the key Project Hubs building on the FAIRDOM-SEEK platform, serving the LiSyM network. Liver Systems Medicine (LiSyM) project is a network of German research centers and institutions, working together to develop a Systems Medicine approach to study early and advanced liver disease. It was funded by the German Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF, Bundesministerium f√ºr Bildung und Forschung) and in the tradition of a 15 year long initiative towards clinically actionable systems understanding of the liver. The BMBF enables active contribution of LiSyM data managers to the FAIRDOM project.

The project members use the [LiSyM SEEK](https://seek.lisym.org) to upload and or interlink experimental data, as well as organizing computational models build from these.
