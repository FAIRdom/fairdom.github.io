The [LiSyM](https://seek.lisym.org) is one of the many Project Hubs supported by the FAIRDOM consortium. Liver Systems Medicine (LiSyM) project is a network of German research centers and institutions, working together to develop a Systems Medicine approach to study early and advanced liver disease. 

The project members use the [LiSym SEEK](https://seek.lisym.org) to manage, organise and collect the new and old experimental data generated by scientists and the computational models build from these.
