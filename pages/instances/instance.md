[FAIRDOM-SEEK](https://seek4science.org/) is the Data Management Platform developed and supported by the members of the FAIRDOM consortium.   

The [FAIRDOM-SEEK](https://seek4science.org/) platform is a mature web-based resource for organising, sharing and publishing heterogeneous scientific research datasets, models or simulations, protocols, workflows, samples, publications and other research outcomes.  

The platform enables the building of Project Hubs where investigators can store, share, access, connect and interact with digital objects generated from their research, and use them in their own analyses.

The [FAIRDOM-SEEK](https://seek4science.org/) can be downloaded, installed and managed locally as hubs or instances providing a solution to data sharing within groups and consortia. Currently three types of hubs are supported:

*	Free Public Hubs 
*	Project Hubs installed and hosted locally 
*	Specialised Hubs
