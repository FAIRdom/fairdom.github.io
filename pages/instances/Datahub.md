[DataHub](https://datahub.elixir-belgium.org) is a **Public Hub** supported by the FAIRDOM Consortium and developed by ELIXIR Belgium. 

It is a management tool that enables researchers to manage research data and produce FAIR data by design. The platform keeps together metadata about experiments 
and links to the associated data files. An important feature of the platform is the integration of standard metadata used by EBI repositories, which makes DataHub also a tool for brokering data towards ELIXIR deposition databases.
