## Description of the Project

The [Centre for Digital Life Norway (DLN)](https://www.digitallifenorway.org) is a national centre for biotechnology research, education and innovation. The centre facilitates transdisciplinary collaboration across institutions, fields of research and the research projects in the centre. 

The transdisciplinary research projects in the centre combine biotechnology with digital technology in health, aquaculture, agriculture, and industrial biotechnology. The centre has more than 40 biotechnology projects led by universities and research institutes all over the country.

DLN supports its projects on research data management aspects. Several of DLN's projects including [DigiSal](https://www.digitallifenorway.org/projects/digisal/index.html), [Cell4Chem](https://www.digitallifenorway.org/projects/Cell4Chem/index.html), [BioZement 2.0](https://www.digitallifenorway.org/projects/biozement-2-0/index.html) and [dCod](https://www.digitallifenorway.org/projects/dcod-1-0/index.html) are users of the FAIRdom Hub.

## Features Included

In order to facilitate data management for Norwegian users, DLN has partnered with [ELIXIR Norway](https://elixir.no/) and integrated FAIRDOM-SEEK platform with the [Norwegian e-Infrastructure for Life Sciences](https://nels.bioinfo.no) to create a seamless user experience.

In order to facilitate creation of projects in SEEK, we have added a feature to create them from maschine-actionable data management plans (maDMPs) according to the [RDA DMP Common Standard](https://github.com/RDA-DMP-Common/RDA-DMP-Common-Standard), which can be exported from e.g. the [Data Stewardship Wizard](https://ds-wizard.org/).
