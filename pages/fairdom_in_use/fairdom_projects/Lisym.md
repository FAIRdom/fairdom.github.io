The [LiSyM SEEK](https://seek.lisym.org) is one of the key Project Hubs build on the FAIRDOM-SEEK platform, serving the LiSyM network. Liver Systems Medicine (LiSyM) project is a network of German research centers and institutions, working together to develop a Systems Medicine approach to study early and advanced liver disease. It was funded by the German Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF, Bundesministerium fÃ¼r Bildung und Forschung) and in the tradition of a 15 year long initiative towards clinically actionable systems understanding of the liver. The BMBF enables active contribution of LiSyM data managers to the FAIRDOM project.

The project members use the [LiSyM SEEK](https://seek.lisym.org) to upload and or interlink experimental data, as well as organizing computational models build from these.

## Description of the Hub

The [LiSyM SEEK](https://seek.lisym.org/) is one of the key Project Hubs building on the FAIRDOM-SEEK platform, serving the Liver Systems Medicine [LiSyM](https://www.lisym.org/) network  and its follow up project LiSyM-Cancer. Research results of both projects are collected and published on the LiSyM-SEEK platform.

[LiSyM-Cancer](https://www.lisym-cancer.org/) is a multidisciplinary research network funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF). Molecular and cell biologists, clinical researchers and experts in mathematical modelling are jointly conducting research to investigate the development of liver cancer from pre-existing conditions such as steatotic liver disease or liver cirrhosis. The aim of the joint project is to identify relevant biomarkers to diagnose and prevent hepatocellular carcinoma at early stages.

Within the LiSyM-Cancer project SEEK integrates data derived from four different platforms which are in use for data storage and exchange depending on the needs of the network members: [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) for short-term data exchange, [REDCap](https://www.project-redcap.org/) for clinical data, [openBIS](https://openbis.ch/) for experimental raw data and its metadata and [OMERO](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/omero/) for image data.

Integrating these different platforms to easily transfer and connect the data and metadata between the different systems is a key task of the data management for LiSyM-Cancer.

## LiSyM SEEK serves as

- a private collaboration space for the LiSyM-Cancer network, for exchanging data (of any format), models and SOPs between partners
- a FAIR public record of sharable results of any file format from the LiSyM-Cancer Network
- a central registry for all publications derived from the LiSyM-Cancer Network
- a registry for data deposited in specific data repositories e.g., GEO
- an optional entry point to upload data to specific data repositories e.g., sequencing data to ENA via use of extended metadata
- a platform for sharing standardised computational liver models

## Features Include

- ISA structure and data attribution
- Extended metadata rich enough to capture the metadata of data items in openBIS, NextCloud, REDCap, OMERO, respectively
- Registering remote data and storing data in one system
- Association of publications and data, export of publications to websites [LiSyM](https://www.lisym.org) and [LiSyM-Cancer](https://www.lisym-cancer.org).
- Fine grained visibility control for single files or larger groups of files
Support for storing, versioning, and running SBML models using JWS Online

## Further Developments

- Yellow pages describing researchers used as input for [LiSyM-Cancer](https://www.lisym-cancer.org) 
- More model types & file types  (e.g. MulticellML, [PEtab](https://petab.readthedocs.io)) 
- Publically available mover tools between SEEK and the other systems using the API
