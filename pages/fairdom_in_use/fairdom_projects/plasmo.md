FAIRDOM provides an opportunity for research project databases to continue to be available long after their original grants have ended. 
By migrating a database to [FAIRDOMHub](/fairdom-in-use/fairdomhub), open research, data sharing and data re-use can continue to be offered.

PlaSMo stands for ‘Plant Systems-biology Modelling’ and the PlaSMo model repository was envisioned by the plant systems biology community in 2005 with the initial funding lasting until 2010. 
The team devised an exit strategy to address the sustainability of the PlaSMo repository and preservation of its data. 
Data was migrated to the public FAIRDOMHub repository using secured funding. 
The migration became feasible following the introduction of the [FAIRDOM-SEEK](/fairdomseek) write API.
