## Introduction
The [LiSyM SEEK](https://seek.lisym.org/) is one of the key Project Hubs building on the FAIRDOM-SEEK platform, serving the LiSyM (Liver Systems Medicine)-Cancer network. [LiSyM-Cancer] (https://www.lisym-cancer.org/) is a multidisciplinary research network funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF). Molecular and cell biologists, clinical researchers and experts in mathematical modeling are jointly conducting research to investigate the development of liver cancer from pre-existing conditions such as steatotic liver disease or liver cirrhosis. The aim of the joint project is to identify relevant biomarkers to diagnose and prevent hepatocellular carcinoma at early stages. The LiSyM-Cancer project is a follow up of LiSyM. Research results of both projects are collected and published on the LiSyM-SEEK platform.

Within the LiSyM-Cancer projects five different platforms are in use for data storage and exchange due to the need of the network members. Integrating these different platforms to easily transfer and connect the data and metadata between the different systems is a key responsibility of the data management team.
