In collaboration with the FAIRDOM Consortium, [DataHub](https://datahub.elixir-belgium.org) is a public FAIRDOM-SEEK instance (a **Public Hub**) developed by [ELIXIR Belgium](https://www.elixir-belgium.org/) with funding from [FWO](https://www.fwo.be/). 

It is a management tool that enables researchers to manage research data and produce FAIR data by design. The platform keeps together metadata about experiments 
and links to the associated data files. An important feature of the platform is the integration of standard metadata used by EBI repositories, which makes DataHub also a tool for brokering data towards ELIXIR deposition databases.
