The [IBISBAKHub](https://hub.ibisba.eu) is a Knowledge Hub for scientific information related to [IBISBA](https://www.ibisba.eu), the European infrastructure producing translational R&D&I services to an international community of Industrial Biotechnology.


## The IBISBAKHub serves as

* a private collaboration space for IBISBA facilities, handing over data, models and SOPs between partners during the execution of projects
* a private recording of the progression and outcome of member projects for IBISBA oversight
* a library of member  contributed SOPs, models, workflows and data templates shared within the IBISBA membership
* a data management resource if a local system is not available to be indexed

## Features

* ISA structure that has an order based on the design-build-test phases of a project
* Helper tool iPOP to set up a project entry on the Hub 
* Integration with a project management system and a service catalogue
* Storing, sharing and launching workflows linked with related data and models
