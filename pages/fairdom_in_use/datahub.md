## Introduction
DataHub is designed to find the optimal balance between providing a structured approach for describing experimental metadata at the sample level, in adherence to the ISA-model for ISA-JSON export, and offering flexibility. This flexibility allows users to capture and incorporate specific experimental metadata that aligns precisely with the unique requirements of their research projects. In other words, while we maintain standards and compliance, we also recognize and accommodate the diverse and specific needs of individual researchers.

In addition, DataHub leverages ISA-JSON standard to streamline the deposition of (meta)data to repositories, placing special emphasis on ELIXIR deposition databases. This approach not only ensures the efficiency of the process but is also designed to inherently uphold the FAIR principlesâ€”making the (meta)data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable by design.
