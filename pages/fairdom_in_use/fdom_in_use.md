**FAIRDOM-SEEK**  can be installed, run and further developed as an own instance, enabling the building of Project Hubs where investigators can store, share, access, connect and interact with digital objects generated from their research, and use them in their own analyses.

Alternatively, FAIRDOM-SEEK can also be used as the web-accessible public Commons platform, [FAIRDOMHub](https://fairdomhub.org/), offering public information and password protected user collaboration spaces.

Include relative_url filter above so that internal URLs still work
in dev site GitHub Pages, where the whole site is hosted within a folder,
not the root URL.
