The first FAIRDOM Mini Hackathon Online is coming up soon. We have **extended the registration period** to Tuesday, 4 February 2025.  We welcome users, developers, leaders and advocates to join us for an opportunity to collaborate, discuss and progress a range of matters and features which will be of benefit to the wider FAIRDOM-SEEK community. If you are interested in learning more about how FAIRDOM-SEEK could benefit your work, please come along too.

The event will run on Zoom on **Thursday, 20 February 2025** for up to 6 hours, providing opportunities for people in eastern North America, western/central Europe and western/central Africa to work together. You will be able to select from a list of topics or suggest your own. The topics relate to RO-Crates, bug finding, search, user interface, metadata and machine learning.
