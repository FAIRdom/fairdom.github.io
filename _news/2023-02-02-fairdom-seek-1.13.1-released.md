This is a small bugfix & minor improvements release, and includes:

  * Fix to forcing a copy when registering data via a URL, using the Upload a copy checkbox.
  * Group together notification emails, to prevent many emails for the same error being sent in quick succession. 
    The are now sent in groups of increasing size, within a configurable time period.
