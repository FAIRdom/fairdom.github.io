title: New Blog - Samples Club 2
---
We held our second Samples Club in Manchester on March 21st-23rd. 
The meeting was jointly hosted between FAIRDOM and ELIXIR-UK, as part of ELIXIR-EXCELERATE. 
Participants with an interest in sample metadata and modelling got together to discuss a range of topics related to a sample-centric interoperability framework driven by use cases.
