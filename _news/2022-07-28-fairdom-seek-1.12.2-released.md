We are pleased to announce a new version of [FAIRDOM-SEEK](/platforms/seek) is now available, which is version 1.12.2

This is a small bugfix release, which includes an important fix for the search.

* A fix to search results not being correctly displayed in order of relevance
* A fix that correctly displays the tab, when linking to a tab (such as related items) using the bookmark (e.g <https://fairdomhub.org/programmes/20#projects> )
