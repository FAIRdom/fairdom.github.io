FAIRDOM supports the COVID-19 disease maps community, a world-wide initiative to establish a visually based knowledge
repository of molecular mechanisms of COVID-19 infection and disease ([https://covid.pages.uni.lu](https://covid.pages.uni.lu)). The FAIRDOMHub
project space is used by the community to share data, documents, literature and computational models on COVID-19, as
well to list contributors. The FAIRDOMHub support is highlighted at the disease maps community
conference ([https://disease-maps.org/DMCM2021](https://disease-maps.org/DMCM2021)).
