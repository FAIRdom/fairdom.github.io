**The new versions of the FAIRDOM/SEEK platform and the [ELIXIR Norwegian e-Infrastructure for Life Sciences (NeLS)](https://nels.bioinfo.no/) are now linked. 
This will provide SEEK and NeLS users with unprecedented opportunities for storing, sharing, and archiving of data in ways that comply 
with the FAIR principles.**

FAIRDOM is committed to ensuring that FAIR data management is simple, practical, and fits in with researchers day-to-day work. As part of this we work with the community in ensuring that key platforms for our partners can integrate smoothly with our data management platforms.

After working closely with our Norwegian Digital Life partners, the new releases of SEEK and NeLS now integrate with each other. This allows access to Norwegian infrastructure for storage, computing and archiving of research data as well as a rich toolbox for FAIR project data management. NeLS supports Norwegian life science researchers in executing Bioinformatics analysis on their data. Using SEEK with NeLS, data or analysis generated within projects can easily be shared among the project participants and made accessible when they are ready for publication.

If you are interested in working with FAIRDOM to integrate with your local or national resources, you can contact us here: [community@fair-dom.org](mailto:community@fair-dom.org)

The integration work of NeLS and SEEK has been funded by the Centre for Digital Life Norway and has been performed in collaboration with ELIXIR Norway and FAIRDOM partners at the University of Manchester. Several Digital Life projects have participated in testing of the new versions.

Digital Life Norway have written a blog post that goes into some more detail: [https://digitallifenorway.org/gb/blog/doing-fair-data-management-is-now-easier-for-norwegian-life-science-researchers](https://digitallifenorway.org/gb/blog/doing-fair-data-management-is-now-easier-for-norwegian-life-science-researchers)
