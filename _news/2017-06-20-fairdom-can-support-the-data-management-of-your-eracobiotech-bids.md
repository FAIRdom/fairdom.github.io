FAIRDOM can support the data management component of your [ERA CoBioTech](https://www.cobiotech.eu/) bids.

We have prepared a [frequently asked questions document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a8wQ72RK8haclNBWY_QWWnX7UmlFfkrEmIkz7ni8sak/edit?usp=sharing). to help you understand more about the data management component of the grant.

To prepare the written data management section we have prepared:

1. [Minimum data management planning checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UagzQuzA-KZqNOPa2Ev8k0QHONl1Lyh6PqpNJ7A4F0g/edit?usp=sharing)
2. A [boiler plate text](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10So_3IXlueVXPXHmBBKYYDMnHSK_MJxQXLDlWZ6PgOY/edit?usp=sharing) that you can use and modify.

We encourage people who want to include us to speak directly with us. You can contact us at community@fair-dom.org.
