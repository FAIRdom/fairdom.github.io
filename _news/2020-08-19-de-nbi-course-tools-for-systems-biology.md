title: "de.NBI Course: 'Tools for Systems biology modeling and data exchange: COPASI, CellNetAnalyzer, SABIO-RK, FAIRDOMHub/SEEK'"
---

During this 3-day course, attendees will learn basic techniques for modeling of biochemical networks 
including data access and storage due to the FAIR principles. 
The first day introduces principles of stoichiometric and constraint-based modeling coupled with hands on exercises 
using CellNetAnalyzer. The second day continues with kinetic modeling techniques which will be illustrated and exercised with COPASI. The third day SABIO-RK is used as a resource for kinetic data and FAIRDOMHub/SEEK is introduced as a data and model management platform fitted to the needs of systems biologists. The hands on exercises throughout the three days will ensure that attendees become familiar with the software tools and with analyzing, creating, editing, importing, simulating and storing biochemical networks.

Date: September 21-23, 2020
