title: Rightfield 0.24 released
---

A new version of **Rightfield**, has been released and is now available for download.

The new version includes a refresh and update of all its dependencies, in particular updated to use the latest version of Apache POI.

Along with an update there have also been a couple of improvements:

* Rightfield will now retain existing data validations, that had been added to an existing Excel document previous to being populated with Rightfield.
 
* Fix to an ambiguity problem with mixed ontologies containing terms with the same label, but from different sources. The ontology hierarchy and term view how includes the namespace prefix where available, and a tooltip will show the full IRI when hovering over a term.

The new version is available to download from the [Rightfield website](https://rightfield.org.uk)
