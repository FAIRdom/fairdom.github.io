We are pleased to announce a new version of [FAIRDOM-SEEK](/platforms/seek) is now available, which is version **1.15.2**

This is a small patch release that includes a couple of important bug fixes:

* Fix to XLSX files incorrectly being detected and changed to a zip mime type in some cases when a processing error occurs.
* Fix to losing the temporary access code in the URL when switching between versions or clicking on the "Back to Model" button.
