The Department of Animal and Aquacultural Sciences seeks a bioinformatician or systems biologist with skills or interest in ontological annotation, 
semantic interoperability or knowledge management, for the systems biology of salmon farming. 
This is a Researcher position of 3 years (with possibility of extension) at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences, Ås, Norway.

The project “Towards the Digital Salmon: From a reactive to a pre-emptive research strategy in aquaculture [(DigiSal)](https://www.nmbu.no/om/fakulteter/vetbio/institutter/iha/forskning/prosjekter/node/24555)” 
is part of Digital Life, Norway’s first call dedicated to systems biology. 
Effective management of data and model resources is key in this endeavour, and DigiSal will initiate The Digital Salmon: A knowledge base of salmon genetics and physiology, interfacing closely with complementary databases, repositories, and research infrastructures such as ELIXIR. This knowledge base is a key deliverable of the DigiSal project, and the long-term ambition is that it will enable aquaculture industry to quickly address emerging challenges, quickly reanalysing existing data and identifying knowledge gaps to rapidly acquire required new data.
