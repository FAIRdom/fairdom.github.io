title: "Registration now open for the first FAIRDOM Mini Hackathon"
---

In a change to our usual FAIRDOM User Meeting format, we have decided to host the first FAIRDOM Mini Hackathon. Users, developers, leaders and advocates will have an opportunity to collaborate, discuss and progress a range of matters and features which will be of benefit to the wider FAIRDOM-SEEK community. We also welcome anybody interested in learning more about FAIRDOM-SEEK and how it could benefit their work.

The event will run on Zoom on **Thursday, 20 February 2025** for 5 hours, providing opportunities for people in eastern North America, western/central Europe and western/central Africa to work together. 
You will be able to select from a list of topics or suggest your own. The topics relate to RO-Crates, bug finding, search, user interface, metadata and machine learning.

For full details and to register, please visit the [FAIRDOM Mini Hackathon 2025 event page](/events/2025-02-20-FAIRDOM-mini-hackathon-online).
