[ERA CoBioTech](https://www.cobiotech.eu/), in collaboration with FAIRDOM, will provide data and model management support to all participating projects.

In accordance with the ERA CoBioTech call, the full proposal stage will require a section of the application dedicated to data and model management.

To help applicants prepare their proposals, and to learn more about the data management needs of the participating projects, FAIRDOM will host a series of webinars.

Dates for webinars will be:

Thu, Feb 2, 2017 3:00 PM – 5:00 PM CET

The webinars will be organised as a 1 hour session and cover what FAIRDOM and its central data management services offer, 
what FAIRDOM would need in terms of collaboration to deliver the best service possible, 
as well as a checklist of data and model management topics to be covered in the proposal. 
This informative session will then be followed by an hour open for questions, discussions, suggestions with the possibility for scheduling breakout sessions.
