We invite you to register for the FAIRDOM Collaboration Fest (CoFest) Online. Users, developers, leaders and advocates will have an opportunity to collaborate, discuss and progress a range of matters and features which will be of benefit to the wider FAIRDOM-SEEK community. We also welcome anybody interested in learning more about FAIRDOM-SEEK and how it could benefit their work.

The event will run on Zoom on **Monday, 2 March 2026** for 2 hours, providing opportunities for people in eastern North America, western/central Europe and western/central Africa to work together.

- Learn about FAIRDOM-SEEK features released in the last 12 months, thanks in part to your contributions at the [FAIRDOM Mini Hackathon](2025-03-13-connections-made-at-fairdom-mini-hackathon) in February 2025.
- **Topic 1: Knowledge Graph and Linked Data**. Join a discussion about querying the public knowledge graph of a FAIRDOM-SEEEK instance, through writing SPARQL queries, using Triple Stores and Extended Metadata.
- **Topic 2: Visualization and LLM Enabling.** Watch a presentation about how Neo4J, visualization tools, and Large Langage Models (LLM) have been combined in NextSEEK to vastly reduce the time bioinformations spend filling out GEO forms.
