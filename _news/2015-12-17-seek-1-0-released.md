We are pleased to announce the release of SEEK version 1.0.

This version of SEEK forms the base version for our new https://fairdomhub.org service, about which we will be releasing more details in the new year.

Included in this version are some key new features:

* Support for the self creation and administration of Programmes, and Projects within them. If this feature is enabled, users will be able to setup their own Programmes and support them without the need of a full SEEK administrator other than the initial activation.
* A refinement of the administrative roles.
* Publishing of entire Investigations as Snapshots – frozen in time as Research Objects (see [http://researchobject.org](http://researchobject.org)), along with a DOI. In the future we will be extending this to also support more fine-grained Studies and Assays.
* There have been many other smaller improvements and changes, more details of which can be found at [http://docs.seek4science.org/tech/releases/](http://docs.seek4science.org/tech/releases#version-100) .

We have also started setting up a new Documentation site available at [http://docs.seek4science.org/](http://docs.seek4science.org/) where we will be publishing technical developer information, and also more in depth user guides and information. This is now integrated with SEEK, and replaces the old internal help system.

With this version we are deprecating the old BioSamples – which we will be replacing with a much improved Sample system during the early part of 2016. 
Please visit our Roapmap at [http://docs.seek4science.org/tech/roadmap.html](http://docs.seek4science.org/tech/roadmap.html) .
We will release more information about Samples early next year.

Details on how to install or upgrade to this version can be found at [http://docs.seek4science.org/get-seek.html](http://docs.seek4science.org/get-seek.html)

After 7 years of continuous development, 1.0 marks a major milestone. 
Many thanks to those that have contributed and supported us in our ongoing journey.
