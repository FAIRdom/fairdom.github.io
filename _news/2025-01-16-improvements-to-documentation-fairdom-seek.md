title: "Improvements to documentation for FAIRDOM-SEEK (navigation and design)"
---

We are delighted to announce that a phase of improvements to the FAIRDOM-SEEK documentation is ready. 

[![FAIRDOM-SEEK documentation banner](/images/news/seek-docs-banner.svg)](https://docs.seek4science.org/)

* [View the improved FAIRDOM-SEEK documentation](https://docs.seek4science.org/)

This update focuses on navigation, design and search. 
We are using the [ELIXIR Toolkit Theme](https://elixir-belgium.github.io/elixir-toolkit-theme/) with custom styling for FAIRDOM-SEEK.
All the old page paths still work. There is minimal change to the Markdown of all pages. The folder structure is the same.

## Design, layout and search

* There is a new **search box** at the top of all pages, with instant results.
* There is a **table of contents** on the right-side to jump to headings within a page.
* You can **scroll to the top** of the page with a button at the bottom-right.
* The fonts and colours have been maintained. 

## Navigation menus

* There is a new **top navigation** linking to the main sections [User Guide](https://docs.seek4science.org/help/user-guide/) and [Technical References](https://docs.seek4science.org/tech/).
* There is a **side navigation** left within each section, listing all pages.
* There is a **footer navigation** including more links than the top navigation.
* The navigation adapts to mobile/tablet devices. 

## Your contributions are welcome

We continue to welcome [contributions to the documentation](https://docs.seek4science.org/contributing-to-pages),
particularly from people who manage their own FAIRDOM-SEEK instance.
The contribution guide has been updated to reflect the minor differences required for new pages, 
for example, we no longer include the `.html` part of the path when linking to other pages on the site.
