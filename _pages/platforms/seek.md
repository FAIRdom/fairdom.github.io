The SEEK platform is a web-based resource for sharing heterogeneous scientific research datasets, models or simulations, processes and research outcomes. 
It preserves associations between them, along with information about the people and organisations involved. The research can be organised into investigations, 
studies and assays (experiments) based on the ISA-Tools format. When paired with our openBIS platform it provides data management support from instrument collection through to publication. Norwegian users benefit from a functional integration with the NeLS Bioinformatics compute platform. An API simplifies upload and download of files.

The SEEK can be downloaded, installed, and managed locally as a solution to data sharing within groups and consortia. In addition, publicly released assets can be made available in the FAIRDOMHub.
