Rightfield is an open-source tool for adding ontology term selection to Excel spreadsheets. Rightfield is used by a ‘Template Creator’ to create semantically aware Excel spreadsheet templates. The Excel templates are then reused by Scientists to collect and annotate their data; without any need to understand, or even be aware of, Rightfield or the ontologies used. Rightfield embedded templates are used within the Samples framework of the SEEK.
