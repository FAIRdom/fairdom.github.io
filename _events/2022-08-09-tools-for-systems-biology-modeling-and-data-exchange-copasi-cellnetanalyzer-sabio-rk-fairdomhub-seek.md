During this 3-day course, attendees will learn basic techniques for modeling of biochemical networks including data access and storage due to the FAIR principles. 
The first day introduces principles of stoichiometric and constraint-based modeling coupled with hands on exercises using CellNetAnalyzer. The second day continues 
with kinetic modeling techniques which will be illustrated and exercised with COPASI. The third day SABIO-RK is used as a resource for kinetic data and FAIRDOMHub/SEEK 
is introduced as a data and model management platform fitted to the needs of systems biologists. The hands on exercises throughout the three days will ensure 
that attendees become familiar with the software tools and with analyzing, creating, editing, importing, simulating and storing biochemical networks.
