### Data management in practice with FAIRDOM-SEEK
 
 
The next FAIRDOM user meeting is scheduled for Tuesday, 16 September 2025 at 14:00 - 16:00 CEST.
 
The purpose of the FAIRDOM user meetings is to establish an active FAIRDOM user community to allow networking between various FAIRDOM-SEEK users and learn from each other's experiences. 
 Within the two-hours event invited users will showcase the use of FAIRDOMHub and other FAIRDOM-SEEK instances for their research projects. After the presentations weâ€™ll have plenty of time for discussions and networking. 
 
Details will follow soon.
