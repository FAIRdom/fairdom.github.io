We would like to invite you to our upcoming event.
Following on from the 2025 FAIRDOM Mini Hackathon, we are hosting a collaboration fest -- CoFest --  a technical focused user meeting. 
Users, developers, leaders and advocates will have an opportunity to collaborate, discuss and progress a range of matters and features which will be of benefit to the wider FAIRDOM-SEEK community. 
We also welcome anybody interested in learning more about FAIRDOM-SEEK and how it could benefit their work.
We will not be doing any actual coding in the session.
