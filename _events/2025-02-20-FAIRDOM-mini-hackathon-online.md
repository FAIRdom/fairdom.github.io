We would like to invite you to our upcoming event. In a change to our usual FAIRDOM User Meeting format, we have decided to host the first FAIRDOM Mini Hackathon. Users, developers, leaders and advocates will have an opportunity to collaborate, discuss and progress a range of matters and features which will be of benefit to the wider FAIRDOM-SEEK community. We also welcome anybody interested in learning more about FAIRDOM-SEEK and how it could benefit their work.
