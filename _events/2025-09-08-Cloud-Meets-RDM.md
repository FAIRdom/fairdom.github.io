## Workshop "Cloud Meets RDM: Unlocking Research Data Management in the Cloud"

Join us on a two-day journey to unlock the potential of cloud-based research data management (RDM). This hands-on training will equip you with the tools, techniques, and best practices needed to start your journey in cloud-based data management and processing.

**Day 1:** 

After a warm welcome we will briefly introduce into the two backing organizations, i.e. "de.KCD - Data Competence Center Cloud Technologies for Data Management and Processing" and "de.NBI - The German Network for Bioinformatics Infrastructure", followed by a short hands-on session on setting up your account 
and getting everyone prepared. For the main part of this day, you'll learn how to use the different de.NBI Cloud resources and services, start and manage virtual machines, transfer and access data and how to deploy  solutions for data management in a cloud environment.

**Day 2:** 

After a general and domain unspecific overview on existing RDM solutions and platforms, we'll dive deeper into FAIRDOM-SEEK, a leading tool for research data management. You'll learn how to manage and organize your data, create and attach metadata descriptions, and collaborate with others. 
Our instructors will guide you through hands-on exercises, ensuring that you're comfortable using these tools to advance your research. Then, we will introduce into the PLANTdataHUB, a cloud-based platform for collaborative storage, management, and sharing of research data that makes use of Annotated Research Contexts
(ARCs), to store experimental data, metadata, and analysesin a FAIR digital object. For the remainder of the second day, we will cover best practices on how to do data processing in cloud environments by effectively 
automating the deployment and configuration of VMs as well as streamline processing pipelines in workflows. Finally, we want to enter into an exchange with you and find out what your requirements for cloud environments are and what support you need in this regard. 


**Takeaways:**

* Understand the basics of cloud computing
* Learn how to set up and use virtual machines in the de.NBI Cloud
* Apply cloud-based solutions for research data management
* Master FAIRDOM-SEEK for data management and collaboration
* Getting knowledge about the PLANTDataHub and ARCs
* Connect cloud storage and compute to effectively analyze your data
