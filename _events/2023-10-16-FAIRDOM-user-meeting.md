### Data management in practice with FAIRDOM-SEEK


The next FAIRDOM user meeting is scheduled for 16th of October, 2023 at 14:00 -16:00 CEST.

The purpose of the FAIRDOM user meetings is to establish an active FAIRDOM user community to allow networking between various FAIRDOM-SEEK users and learn from each other's experiences. 
Within the two-hours event invited users will showcase the use of FAIRDOMHub and other FAIRDOM-SEEK instances for their research projects. After the presentations weâ€™ll have plenty of time for discussions and networking. 

Details will follow soon.
