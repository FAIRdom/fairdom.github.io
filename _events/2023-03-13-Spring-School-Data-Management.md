The German Network for Bioinformatics Infrastructure ([de.NBI](https://www.denbi.de)) is organizing the de.NBI Spring School which covers all important aspects 
of research data management: data life cycle, FAIR data principles and reproducibility. 

The goal of the event is to raise awareness for the importance of proper research data management (RDM) in general, but it will also provide a practical toolbox for the RDM topics Data Management Planning, FAIR data and Reproducibility. Furthermore, a practical training on accessing the data for re-use and integration are part of the learning goals.
