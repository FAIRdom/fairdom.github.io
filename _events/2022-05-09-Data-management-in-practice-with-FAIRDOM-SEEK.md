It has been a while since the FAIRDOM community got together to exchange ideas and share our FAIRDOM-SEEK related experiences. 
We’re therefore very excited to announce a new series of FAIRDOM user meetings, with the first meeting scheduled for 9th of May, 2022 at 14:00 CEST.

The purpose is to establish an active FAIRDOM user community to allow networking between various FAIRDOM-SEEK users and learn from each other's experiences. 
Within the two-hours event the FAIRDOM team will give an introduction on current developments and the invited users will showcase the use of FAIRDOMHub and other FAIRDOM-SEEK instances for their research projects. After the presentations we’ll have plenty of time for discussions and networking. 

Confirmed invited speakers: 
  * Cyril Pommier
  * Frank Meineke - Leipzig Health Atlas ([https://www.health-atlas.de](https://www.health-atlas.de/))
  * Jasper Koehorst - WorkflowHub ([https://workflowhub.eu](https://workflowhub.eu))
  * Andrej Blejec - Bulk uploading from pISA-tree to FAIRDOM using SEEK API and R package seekr
